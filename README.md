The utilization of single-cell combinatorial indexing sequencing via droplet microfluidics presents an attractive approach for balancing cost, scalability, robustness, and accessibility. Nevertheless, existing methodologies necessitate tailored protocols for individual modalities, which may constrain their potential for automation and hinder clinical applications. Introducing UDA-seq, a universal workflow that integrates a straightforward post-indexing step to enhance throughput and systematically adapt existing droplet-based single-cell multimodal methods. UDA-seq was subjected to benchmarking across various tissue and cell types, successfully enabling several prevalent multimodal tasks, including single-cell co-assay of RNA and VDJ, RNA and chromatin, and RNA and CRISPR perturbation. Notably, UDA-seq facilitated the efficient generation of over 100,000 high-quality single-cell data from three dozen frozen clinical biopsy specimens in a singular-channel experiment of droplet microfluidics. Subsequent analysis substantiated the potency of our approach in identifying rare cell subpopulations associated with clinical phenotypes and probing the vulnerability of cancer cells.
